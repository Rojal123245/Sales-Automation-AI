Sales Automation AI

Project Overview

Sales Automation AI is a system designed to automate the inventory ordering process for retail stores. By analyzing past sales data, it predicts future demand, ensuring optimal stock levels. The system automatically places orders for items through warehouse systems using automation tools, generates performance reports, and provides insights into inventory management. It also serves as a SaaS product, allowing users to monitor AI performance and customize features.

Roadmap

Phase 1: Data Collection and Preprocessing

Objective: Gather and clean historical sales data.

Steps:

Collect 3 years of sales data, including item names, sales volume, prices, stock levels, and dates.

Preprocess the data: Handle missing values, normalize numerical fields, and create derived features (e.g., moving averages, sell-through rates).

Identify key performance metrics such as sales trends, revenue contribution, and stale inventory.

Deliverables:

Cleaned dataset with engineered features.

Summary statistics and visualizations for exploratory data analysis (EDA).

Phase 2: Model Development

Objective: Build predictive models for sales and inventory management.

Steps:

Develop regression models (e.g., Linear Regression, ARIMA) for future sales predictions.

Use classification models (e.g., Random Forest, Logistic Regression) to label items as "Reorder," "Review," or "No Action."

Validate models with metrics such as RMSE, precision, and recall.

Deliverables:

Trained and validated prediction models.

Code to retrain models periodically with new data.

Phase 3: Automation System

Objective: Automate the ordering process.

Steps:

Use Selenium or similar tools to interact with warehouse systems and place orders.

Implement logic to input item codes/names, quantities, and confirm orders.

Set up logging and error handling for automation tasks.

Deliverables:

Automated ordering scripts.

Configurable settings for warehouse integration.

Phase 4: Reporting and Insights

Objective: Provide actionable insights for users.

Steps:

Create dashboards showing:

Top-performing items.

Underperforming items.

Suggested reorder quantities.

Stock level forecasts.

Generate downloadable reports (e.g., PDF, CSV).

Deliverables:

Interactive dashboard and periodic report generation functionality.

Phase 5: SaaS Product Development

Objective: Make the system available as a SaaS product.

Steps:

Develop a multi-tenant web application with user authentication and access control.

Implement an admin panel for configuration and monitoring.

Offer subscription plans and billing integrations.

Deliverables:

Deployed SaaS platform.

Documentation for onboarding users.

Phase 6: Testing and Deployment

Objective: Ensure system reliability and scalability.

Steps:

Conduct unit, integration, and end-to-end testing.

Test automation scripts across different warehouse platforms.

Deploy the system on cloud infrastructure (e.g., AWS, GCP, Azure).

Deliverables:

Tested and deployed system.

Post-deployment monitoring setup.
